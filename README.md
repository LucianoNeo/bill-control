# Expense-control
Starting a home expense control, to exercise my study of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Initial Objectives:

- register of expenses divided into 4 categories ( fixas, lanches, extras and parceladas)
- visualization of all categories selecting by month
- initially saving the data in local json
- save this on a database (backend learning required...)
